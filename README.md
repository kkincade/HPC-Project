# High Performance Computing Project
As a project for HPC at the Colorado School of Mines, this project implements Finite State Machines on a GPU using CUDA. It utilizes the large amount of cores on the GPU to brute force a solution to the FSM. The program was tested on three different GPUs including a Macbook Pro, Mac Pro, and a NVIDIA GPU provided by the School of Mines. 

Developed by Ryan Langewisch and Kameron Kincade.
